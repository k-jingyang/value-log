//! Generic value log implementation for key-value separated storage.
//!
//! > This crate is intended as a building block for key-value separated storage.
//! > You probably want to use <https://github.com/fjall-rs/fjall> instead.
//!
//! The value log's contents are split into segments, each segment holds a sorted
//! list of key-value pairs:
//!
//! [k0, v0][k1, v1][k2, v2][k3, v3][k4, v4]
//!
//! The value log does not have an index - to efficiently retrieve an item, a
//! [`ValueHandle`] needs to be retrieved from an [`IndexReader`]. Using the
//! value handle then allows loading the value from the value log.
//!
//! Recently retrieved ("hot") items may be cached by an in-memory value cache to avoid
//! repeated disk accesses.
//!
//! As data changes, old values will unnecessarily occupy disk space. As space amplification
//! increases, stale data needs to be discarded by rewriting old segments (garbage collection).
//! This process can happen on-line.
//!
//! Even though segments are internally sorted, which may help with range scans, data may not be stored
//! contiguously, which hurts read performance of ranges. Point reads also require an extra level of
//! indirection, as the value handle needs to be retrieved from the index. However, this index is generally
//! small, so ideally it can be cached efficiently. And because compaction needs to rewrite less data, more
//! disk I/O is freed to fulfill write and read requests.
//!
//! In summary, a value log trades read & space amplification for superior write
//! amplification when storing large blobs.
//!
//! Use a value log, when:
//! - you are storing large values (HTML pages, big JSON, small images, archiving, ...)
//! - your data is rarely deleted or updated, or you do not have strict disk space requirements
//! - your access pattern is point read heavy
